# PRESENT_VHDL
Implementation of PRESENT KEY algorithm in VHDL. As a part of my study of VHDL, I tried to convert my implementation of PRESENT algorithm from Verilog to VHDL.

This project follows the same state machine and implementation as this project: https://github.com/rrquizon1/PRESENT_VERILOG

Sample simulation output for this project is below:
